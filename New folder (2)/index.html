            Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows.
             An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. 
             It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen).
              The user can switch between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination. 
              The text mode is unavailable in Windows Vista and later.
             Starting with Windows 10, however, a native full-screen mode is available.
